# xpress-router
An opinionated router for express. 

This router assumes that you are willing to route the request into controller.action(). and by defult it assumes the controller files are located in `./controller` directory and end in `-controller.js` file names. you can always change these options.

Also note that you can specify a `resource` name and the router will generate the CRUD routes for you. 

install it via npm:

    npm install express-router --save

simply use it this way:

    var express = require('express');
    var router = require('xpress-router');

    var app = express();
    var routes = [
      {method: 'get', path: '/', controller: 'home', action: 'index'},
      {resource: '/books', controller: 'books'}
    ]

This code will register these routes:

    GET / -> home.index
    GET /books -> books.index
    GET /books/add -> books.add
    POST /books -> books.create
    GET /books/:id -> books.show
    GET /books/:id/edit -> books.edit
    PUT /books/:id -> books.update
    DELETE /books/:id -> books.delete

a sample content for `./controllers/home-controller.js` file would be:

    function index(req, res, next){
      res.end('This is our homepage.');
    }

    module.exports.index = index;
